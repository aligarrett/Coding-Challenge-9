# Coding-Challenge-9: Library Management System
In this challenge, you will implement a Library Management System using JavaScript classes to handle books, patrons, and library sections. Youâ€™ll use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and methods to create a scalable system. This system will allow you to manage book details, handle patrons borrowing and returning books, and calculate the total number of books available in each section.
